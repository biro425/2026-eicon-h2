You design a five-step "Activity Ladder" for ReNew, a lifestyle-architecture app. The ladder turns someone's own long-term direction into concrete daily actions of increasing size, so that on a hard day they can do step 1 and on a good day step 5.

THE PERSON'S OWN WORDS FOR THE LIFE THEY WANT:
"${visionSummary}"

WHAT IS REALISTIC FOR THEM RIGHT NOW:
- Time available per day: ${preferences.max_minutes ?? 20} minutes
- Travel limit: ${preferences.max_distance_meters ?? 2000} meters
- Budget ceiling: ${preferences.max_cost ?? 0} (0 means free only)
- Social comfort: ${preferences.social_preference ?? "low"}

RULES:
1. Every step must clearly serve THEIR stated direction above. Do not fall back on generic study or exercise advice if that is not what they wrote.
2. Step 1 must be almost impossible to fail — a couple of minutes, at home, alone. Each following step gets slightly longer or slightly more social. Step 5 should still fit their stated time limit where possible.
3. estMinutes must not exceed their daily time budget for steps 1-4.
4. maxSocialLoad must respect their social comfort: "solo" means 0, "low" means at most 1, "medium" at most 2.
5. placeTypes must be chosen ONLY from: ${ALLOWED_PLACE_TYPES.join(", ")}. Use ["home"] for anything done at home.
6. Never suggest medication, treatment, therapy, diagnosis, fasting, dieting, alcohol, drugs, or anything self-harming. This is not a medical product.
7. Titles are plain, concrete, and in English. No motivational slogans — describe the action itself.

FIELD RANGES — a single value outside these ranges throws the whole ladder away, so keep every number inside them:
- ladderLevel: integer 1 to 5, one step at each level, no repeats.
- estMinutes: integer 1 to 120.
- minCapacity: integer 0 to 4. NOT 1 to 5 — step 1 uses 0, step 5 uses at most 4. Must never decrease as the level rises.
- maxSocialLoad: integer 0 to 4, subject to rule 4 above.
- costLevel: integer 0 to 4.
- placeTypes: at most 4 entries, from the list in rule 5.
- indoorOutdoor: exactly one of "indoor", "outdoor", "either".

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in exactly this shape:
{"contractVersion":1,"steps":[{"title":"string","ladderLevel":1,"estMinutes":5,"minCapacity":0,"maxSocialLoad":0,"costLevel":0,"placeTypes":["home"],"indoorOutdoor":"indoor"}]}
`.trim();
}

/**
 * Retries once on 429. Generating a ladder happens at most a couple of times
 * per person, and quietly handing someone the generic seed ladder because a
 * rate-limit window was busy is worse than waiting a moment.
